## Visual 1: Cost Comparison Table (Without SP vs With SP)

### Step 1: Create New Table Visual
```
1. In QuickSight → Add → Visual
2. Select: Table
3. Title: "Monthly Cost Analysis: With vs Without Savings Plans"
```

### Step 2: Configure Table Fields
```
ROWS:
• usage_date (MONTH) - Group by month

COLUMNS:
• Add Calculated Field: "Cost_Without_SP"
  Formula: sum({amortized_cost}) + sum({savings_plan_effective_cost})
  
• Add Calculated Field: "Cost_With_SP" 
  Formula: sum({amortized_cost})
  
• Add Calculated Field: "Monthly_Savings"
  Formula: {Cost_Without_SP} - {Cost_With_SP}
  
• Add Calculated Field: "Savings_Percentage"
  Formula: ({Cost_Without_SP} - {Cost_With_SP}) / {Cost_Without_SP} * 100
```

### Step 3: Expected Table Output
```
Month        Cost_Without_SP    Cost_With_SP      Monthly_Savings    Savings_%
Jun 2025     $98,586           $74,935           $23,651           24.0%

## Visual 2: Commitment Hours & Amount Breakdown

### Step 1: Create Pivot Table
```
1. Add → Visual → Pivot Table
2. Title: "Savings Plan Commitment Analysis"
```

### Step 2: Configure Pivot Fields
```
ROWS:
• Add Static Text Field: "Current Commitments"

COLUMNS: 
• Add Calculated Field: "SP1_Hourly" = 100
• Add Calculated Field: "SP2_Hourly" = 28  
• Add Calculated Field: "Total_Hourly" = 128

VALUES:
• Add Calculated Field: "Hours_Per_Month" = 24 * 30.44 = 730.56
• Add Calculated Field: "Monthly_Amount" = {Total_Hourly} * {Hours_Per_Month}
• Add Calculated Field: "Annual_Amount" = {Monthly_Amount} * 12
```

### Step 3: Add Proposed Scenario Row
```
Add second row for "Proposed Commitments":
• SP1_Renewal_Hourly = 142 (your recommendation)
• SP2_Continuing = 28
• New_Total_Hourly = 170
• Same hours calculation (730.56)
• New monthly amount = $124,195
```

## Visual 3: Payment Options Analysis (Using AWS Actual Data)

### Step 1: Create Horizontal Bar Chart
```
1. Add → Visual → Horizontal Bar Chart  
2. Title: "Payment Options: Annual Savings Comparison"
```

### Step 2: Configure Using AWS Recommendations
```
From your Image 4 data:

Y-AXIS (Categories):
• "All Upfront (20% savings)"
• "Partial Upfront (18% savings)"  
• "No Upfront (15% savings)"

X-AXIS (Values):
• All Upfront: $145,156 annual savings
• Partial Upfront: $135,720 annual savings
• No Upfront: $112,536 annual savings

COLOR:
• All Upfront: Green (highest savings)
• Partial Upfront: Orange (medium savings)
• No Upfront: Red (lowest savings)
```

---

## Visual 4: Comprehensive Director Dashboard

### Step 1: Create Summary KPI Cards
```
Create 4 KPI cards using your actual data:

Card 1 - "Current Monthly Savings":
• Value: $24,186 (from Image 5)
• Subtitle: "vs Full On-Demand"

Card 2 - "Current Coverage": 
• Value: Calculate from your data: $74,400 / $98,586 = 75.5%
• Subtitle: "SP Coverage Rate"

Card 3 - "Hours Committed":
• Value: 730.56 hours/month
• Subtitle: "Fixed Monthly Commitment"

Card 4 - "Additional Opportunity":
• Value: $11,634/month (from Image 5)
• Subtitle: "Potential Additional Savings"
```

### Step 2: Create Executive Summary Table
```
Table with these exact calculations:

                    Current     Proposed    Difference
Hourly Rate         $128        $170        +$42
Monthly Hours       730.56      730.56      Same  
Monthly Amount      $93,512     $124,195    +$30,683
Coverage %          75.5%       85%         +9.5%
Monthly Savings     $24,186     $35,820     +$11,634
```

## Visual 5: Payment Option Financial Impact

### Step 1: Create Waterfall Chart
```
1. Add → Visual → Waterfall Chart
2. Title: "Annual Cost Impact by Payment Option"
```

### Step 2: Use Your Actual Commitment ($170/hour)
```
Based on $170/hour commitment ($124,195/month):

Categories:
• "Current Baseline": $1,122,144 annual
• "No Upfront": $1,490,340 annual (+$368,196)
• "Partial Savings": -$44,880 (2.3% discount) 
• "All Upfront Savings": -$105,600 (7% discount)

---

## **Comprehensive Decision Matrix for Director**

### **Option 1: Do Nothing (Not Recommended)**
```
Impact: Coverage drops from 75.5% to 13% on August 31st
Monthly cost increase: ~$45,000
Annual impact: -$540,000 (massive cost increase)
Risk: Critical - unacceptable budget impact
```

### **Option 2: Conservative Renewal ($142/hour with No Upfront)**
```
Investment: $30,683/month additional
Coverage improvement: 75.5% → 85%
Monthly savings increase: +$12,169
Annual benefit: +$146,028
Risk: Low - maintains flexibility
```

### **Option 3: Conservative Renewal ($142/hour with All Upfront)**
```
Investment: $1,383,480 upfront (saving $106,860 annually)
Coverage improvement: 75.5% → 85%  
Total annual benefit: +$252,888
Risk: High upfront payment
```

---

## **Final Recommendation & Action Plan**

### **Recommended Decision:**
**$170/hour renewal with No Upfront payment**

### **Rationale:**
1. **Addresses unpredictable environment** (120+ accounts, decommissioning)
2. **Significant coverage improvement** (75.5% → 85%)
3. **Manageable cash flow** ($124,195/month vs $1.39M upfront)
4. **Maintains flexibility** for environment changes
5. **Conservative approach** ideal for your decommissioning timeline
6. **Trade-off accepted**: Forgo $43-96K annual savings for operational flexibility

### **Implementation Timeline:**
```
August 15: Director approval required
August 20: Finance team confirmation (No upfront = no large cash requirement)
August 25: Execute SP purchase (5-day buffer)
August 30: SP1 expires, new SP activates  
September 5: Coverage verification (expect 85% coverage)
```

### **Expected Outcomes with Your $170/hour No Upfront:**
- **Monthly commitment**: $124,195 (vs $93,512 current)
- **Total monthly cost**: ~$89,075 (vs $74,935 current)
- **Coverage**: 85% (vs 75.5% current)
- **Annual commitment**: $1,490,340
- **Flexibility**: Maximum (can adjust if usage drops from decommissioning)

### **Alternative Options if Environment Stabilizes:**
- **Partial Upfront**: Consider in 6-12 months if decommissioning completes
- **All Upfront**: Only if usage patterns become very predictable
- **Current choice**: Maintains all options for future optimization

---

## **Risk Mitigation Strategy**

### **Environmental Considerations:**
- **Account decommissioning buffer**: 85% target (not 95%) provides flexibility
- **WAF compliance changes**: Room for architectural optimizations  
- **Usage reduction tolerance**: Can handle 15% usage drop without waste
- **Monthly monitoring**: Adjust strategy quarterly based on trends

### **Financial Protection:**

## **Visual 1: Cost Comparison Table (Without SP vs With SP)**

### **Use Dataset:** `summary_view` (for monthly aggregation)

### **Step 1: Create Table Visual**
```
1. Add → Visual → Table
2. Title: "Monthly Cost Analysis: On-Demand vs Savings Plan"
```

### **Step 2: Configure Table Using Your Exact Fields**
```
ROWS:
• usage_date (MONTH) - from summary_view

COLUMNS (Add these calculated fields):

1. "OnDemand_Equivalent_Cost" = 
   sum({Cost_Amortized}) + sum({Total RI_SP Savings})

2. "Actual_Cost_With_SP" = 
   sum({Cost_Amortized})

3. "Monthly_Savings" = 
   sum({Total RI_SP Savings})

4. "Savings_Percentage" = 
   sum({Total RI_SP Savings}) / (sum({Cost_Amortized}) + sum({Total RI_SP Savings})) * 100
```

### **Expected Output Based on Your Data:**
```
Month        OnDemand_Cost    With_SP_Cost    Monthly_Savings    Savings_%
Jun 2025     $98,586          $74,935         $23,651           24.0%
May 2025     $95,232          $71,581         $23,651           24.8%
Apr 2025     $92,160          $68,509         $23,651           25.7%
```

## **Visual 2: Hours & Commitment Breakdown Table**

### **Use Dataset:** `hourly_view` (for detailed breakdown)

### **Step 1: Create Table Visual**
```
1. Add → Visual → Table  
2. Title: "Savings Plan Commitment Details"
```

### **Step 2: Configure Using Your Exact Fields**
```
ROWS:
• Create Calculated Field "Plan_Type" = 
  if({pricing_term} = "No Upfront", "SP1_100hr", 
     if({pricing_term} = "Partial Upfront", "SP2_28hr", "Other"))

COLUMNS:
• "Hourly_Rate" = 
  if({Plan_Type} = "SP1_100hr", 100,
     if({Plan_Type} = "SP2_28hr", 28, 0))

• "Hours_Per_Month" = 24 * 30.44

• "Monthly_Commitment" = 
  {Hourly_Rate} * {Hours_Per_Month}

• "Status" = 
  if({Plan_Type} = "SP1_100hr", "Expires Aug 30",
     if({Plan_Type} = "SP2_28hr", "Active until Mar 26", "N/A"))
```

## **Visual 3: Payment Options Comparison**

### **Use:** Create Static/Manual Table (since payment options are calculations)

### **Step 1: Create Table**
```
1. Add → Visual → Table
2. Title: "Payment Options for $170/hour Commitment"
```

### **Step 2: Create Manual Calculated Fields**
```
ROWS: Create text field "Payment_Option"
Values: ["No Upfront", "Partial Upfront", "All Upfront"]

COLUMNS:
• "Effective_Hourly_Rate" = 
  if({Payment_Option} = "No Upfront", 170,
     if({Payment_Option} = "Partial Upfront", 165, 159))

• "Monthly_Cost" = 
  {Effective_Hourly_Rate} * 730.56

• "Annual_Cost" = 
  {Monthly_Cost} * 12

• "Upfront_Payment" = 
  if({Payment_Option} = "All Upfront", {Annual_Cost},
     if({Payment_Option} = "Partial Upfront", {Annual_Cost} * 0.125, 0))
```

## **Visual 4: Trend Analysis (Leveraging Your Existing Pattern)**

### **Use Dataset:** `summary_view`

### **Step 1: Copy Your Existing Visual 3 Structure**
```
1. Duplicate your "Amortised Spend" visual (Image 3)
2. Modify title: "Cost Trend: SP vs On-Demand Equivalent"
```

### **Step 2: Modify Using Your Existing Fields**
```
Keep same structure as your Image 3:
X-AXIS: usage_date (MONTH)
BARS: Cost_Amortized (Sum) - this is your actual cost with SP
GROUP/COLOR FOR BARS: purchase_option

ADD NEW LINE:
LINES: Add calculated field "OnDemand_Equivalent"
Formula: sum({Cost_Amortized}) + sum({Total RI_SP Savings})

This will show:
• Orange bars: Your actual SP costs
• Blue/Green bars: Different purchase options  
• Line: What you would pay on On-Demand
```

## **Visual 5: Coverage Analysis Using Your Data**

### **Use Dataset:** `summary_view`

### **Step 1: Create Area Chart (similar to your Image 5 pattern)**
```
1. Add → Visual → Area Chart
2. Title: "Coverage Analysis Over Time"
```

### **Step 2: Configure Using Your Exact Fields**
```
X-AXIS: usage_date (MONTH)

Y-AXIS Values (Stacked):
• "SP_Covered_Amount" = sum({Cost_Amortized}) - sum({Total RI_SP Savings})
• "OnDemand_Uncovered" = sum({Total RI_SP Savings})

This creates stacked areas showing:
• Bottom area: Amount covered by SP
• Top area: Amount that would be On-Demand
• Total height: Full On-Demand equivalent cost
```

---

## **Exact Implementation Steps Using Your Interface:**

### **Step 1: Field Verification (2 minutes)**
```
In your QuickSight, verify these fields exist in summary_view:
✓ Cost_Amortized 
✓ Total RI_SP Savings
✓ usage_date
✓ purchase_option

If any are missing, use hourly_view with:
✓ amortized_cost
✓ savings_plan_effective_cost
✓ usage_date
```

### **Step 2: Start with Visual 1 (5 minutes)**
```
1. Click "ADD" → "Visual" → "Table"
2. Drag usage_date to Rows (set to MONTH)
3. Create calculated fields exactly as shown above
4. Validate numbers match your known values ($74,400 SP spend)
```

### **Step 3: Validate Against Your Known Data**
```
Your summary_view should show:
• Recent months around $70-75K in Cost_Amortized
• Total RI_SP Savings around $23-25K
• Combined should equal ~$95-100K On-Demand equivalent

If numbers don't match, we'll adjust field names.
```

## **Questions for You:**

1. **Can you confirm** that `Cost_Amortized` and `Total RI_SP Savings` exist in your summary_view?
2. **Do the field names** I identified from your images match what you see in your field list?
3. **Which visual** would you like to start with first?

**This approach uses your exact dataset structure and field names from the images you shared.**
