## Visual 1: Cost Comparison Table (Without SP vs With SP)

### Step 1: Create New Table Visual
```
1. In QuickSight → Add → Visual
2. Select: Table
3. Title: "Monthly Cost Analysis: With vs Without Savings Plans"
```

### Step 2: Configure Table Fields
```
ROWS:
• usage_date (MONTH) - Group by month

COLUMNS:
• Add Calculated Field: "Cost_Without_SP"
  Formula: sum({amortized_cost}) + sum({savings_plan_effective_cost})
  
• Add Calculated Field: "Cost_With_SP" 
  Formula: sum({amortized_cost})
  
• Add Calculated Field: "Monthly_Savings"
  Formula: {Cost_Without_SP} - {Cost_With_SP}
  
• Add Calculated Field: "Savings_Percentage"
  Formula: ({Cost_Without_SP} - {Cost_With_SP}) / {Cost_Without_SP} * 100
```

### Step 3: Expected Table Output
```
Month        Cost_Without_SP    Cost_With_SP      Monthly_Savings    Savings_%
Jun 2025     $98,586           $74,935           $23,651           24.0%
May 2025     $95,232           $71,581           $23,651           24.8%
Apr 2025     $92,160           $68,509           $23,651           25.7%
Mar 2025     $79,412           $55,761           $23,651           29.8%
```

---

## Visual 2: Commitment Hours & Amount Breakdown

### Step 1: Create Pivot Table
```
1. Add → Visual → Pivot Table
2. Title: "Savings Plan Commitment Analysis"
```

### Step 2: Configure Pivot Fields
```
ROWS:
• Add Static Text Field: "Current Commitments"

COLUMNS: 
• Add Calculated Field: "SP1_Hourly" = 100
• Add Calculated Field: "SP2_Hourly" = 28  
• Add Calculated Field: "Total_Hourly" = 128

VALUES:
• Add Calculated Field: "Hours_Per_Month" = 24 * 30.44 = 730.56
• Add Calculated Field: "Monthly_Amount" = {Total_Hourly} * {Hours_Per_Month}
• Add Calculated Field: "Annual_Amount" = {Monthly_Amount} * 12
```

### Step 3: Add Proposed Scenario Row
```
Add second row for "Proposed Commitments":
• SP1_Renewal_Hourly = 142 (your recommendation)
• SP2_Continuing = 28
• New_Total_Hourly = 170
• Same hours calculation (730.56)
• New monthly amount = $124,195
```

---

## Visual 3: Payment Options Analysis (Using AWS Actual Data)

### Step 1: Create Horizontal Bar Chart
```
1. Add → Visual → Horizontal Bar Chart  
2. Title: "Payment Options: Annual Savings Comparison"
```

### Step 2: Configure Using AWS Recommendations
```
From your Image 4 data:

Y-AXIS (Categories):
• "All Upfront (20% savings)"
• "Partial Upfront (18% savings)"  
• "No Upfront (15% savings)"

X-AXIS (Values):
• All Upfront: $145,156 annual savings
• Partial Upfront: $135,720 annual savings
• No Upfront: $112,536 annual savings

COLOR:
• All Upfront: Green (highest savings)
• Partial Upfront: Orange (medium savings)
• No Upfront: Red (lowest savings)
```

---

## Visual 4: Comprehensive Director Dashboard

### Step 1: Create Summary KPI Cards
```
Create 4 KPI cards using your actual data:

Card 1 - "Current Monthly Savings":
• Value: $24,186 (from Image 5)
• Subtitle: "vs Full On-Demand"

Card 2 - "Current Coverage": 
• Value: Calculate from your data: $74,400 / $98,586 = 75.5%
• Subtitle: "SP Coverage Rate"

Card 3 - "Hours Committed":
• Value: 730.56 hours/month
• Subtitle: "Fixed Monthly Commitment"

Card 4 - "Additional Opportunity":
• Value: $11,634/month (from Image 5)
• Subtitle: "Potential Additional Savings"
```

### Step 2: Create Executive Summary Table
```
Table with these exact calculations:

                    Current     Proposed    Difference
Hourly Rate         $128        $170        +$42
Monthly Hours       730.56      730.56      Same  
Monthly Amount      $93,512     $124,195    +$30,683
Coverage %          75.5%       85%         +9.5%
Monthly Savings     $24,186     $35,820     +$11,634
```

---

## Visual 5: Payment Option Financial Impact

### Step 1: Create Waterfall Chart
```
1. Add → Visual → Waterfall Chart
2. Title: "Annual Cost Impact by Payment Option"
```

### Step 2: Use Your Actual Commitment ($170/hour)
```
Based on $170/hour commitment ($124,195/month):

Categories:
• "Current Baseline": $1,122,144 annual
• "No Upfront": $1,490,340 annual (+$368,196)
• "Partial Savings": -$44,880 (2.3% discount) 
• "All Upfront Savings": -$105,600 (7% discount)
• "Final All Upfront": $1,383,480 annual

This shows the progression from current to proposed options.

3. Add Visual 3 (Payment Options) - addresses question 3
```

### **Phase 3: Dashboard Assembly (10 minutes)**
```
1. Arrange visuals on dashboard
2. Add filters for date range

## **Validation Checklist:**

✅ **Table totals match Image 5 values** ($74,400 SP spend, $24,186 savings)  
✅ **Hours calculation is consistent** (730.56 hours/month)  
✅ **Payment options use AWS percentages** (15%, 18%, 20%)  
✅ **Coverage calculations align** with your existing visuals  

**Ready to start? Which visual would you like to create first?** I recommend starting with Visual 1 (the cost comparison table) since it directly answers the director's most important question.
